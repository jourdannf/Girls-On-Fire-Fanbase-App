## Girls On Fire Fanbase Application

# Project Description

Girls On Fire Fanbase Application acts as an all-in-one hub for fans of the K-pop vocal survival show, Girls On Fire. On the application, users can learn more about the show, view their performances from the show, and learn more about contestants.

# Functionality

* Users can visit the home page to get a brief debrief about the show.
* Users can visit the contestants page to filter through contestants they're interested in and learn about who won the show.
* Users can visit the performances page all the performances from the entire show or filter by contestants or rounds.
* Users can visit their own profile to see who their favorite contestants are.

# Note

For the sake of time constraints, users are not authenticated and images are stored in the application folder.

# Languages Used
* MERN Stack

# Future Additional Features

Alongside fixing the interactivity that is currently available on the site, I'd like to add several things including:
* A page dedicated to the group formed from the show
* Dedicated pages to each contestant
* Liking feature for contestants and performances
* Login functionality
* Chat room for discussions about the show and the group
